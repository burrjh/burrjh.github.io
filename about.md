Machine Learning Engineer
based in Germany

### Some Information

My first contact with Artificial Intelligence was from a perspective of Cognitive Science: modeling the human brain. I was fascinated and convinced I wanted to study Machine Learning deeply to fully understand it. In my masters of Data Science I had the chance to study Statistics, Computer Science and choose applied courses in Machine Learning. Besides, I had the opportunity to pratically work with Deep Learning models for Object Detection as well as Natural Language Processing.
